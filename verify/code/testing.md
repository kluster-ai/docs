## 6. Tabbed Content

> **What is tabbed content?**  
> Tabbed content allows you to group related information under tabs, so users can quickly switch between different contexts without leaving the page.  
> This is especially useful for code examples in multiple languages, comparing configurations, or showing alternative approaches to the same problem.  
> Unlike tables, which display information side by side in rows and columns, tabbed content hides and reveals information depending on the active tab.

Below are some practical examples:

=== "Python"
    This tab describes how you could implement the feature in Python.
    It explains the logic without showing actual code.

=== "Bash"
    This tab explains the same concept from the perspective of Bash scripting.
    Again, the explanation focuses on the idea instead of displaying code.

=== "Expected Output"
    This tab tells you what the outcome should be when the feature works correctly,
    regardless of the chosen implementation method.
