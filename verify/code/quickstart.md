# Get started with Verify Code

Modern developers increasingly rely on AI coding assistants to accelerate development, but this speed comes with risks. Generated code may contain logic errors, security flaws, or performance issues that compromise application quality and security.

The [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} Code verification service integrates directly into your development workflow, automatically scanning AI-generated code in real-time. It catches potential issues instantly within your IDE, allowing you to ship code confidently while maintaining the speed benefits of AI-assisted development.
