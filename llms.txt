## Source Code Repos
Frequently used source code repositories essential for working with this project. Each entry includes the repository name, GitHub URL, and a short description of what the repo contains or enables. These repositories contain the source code referenced by these docs. Use them for API references, code examples, or implementation details.
- [kluster.ai cookbook](https://github.com/kluster-ai/klusterai-cookbook): This repository is a collection of guides and examples designed to help developers unlock the full potential of kluster.ai.
- [Verify Guardrail Validator](https://github.com/kluster-ai/verify-guardrails-validator): This validator detects hallucinations in AI-generated content using kluster.ai's Code Reviews. The service can evaluate the AI response based on a given context, which makes it great for RAG applications. Without providing a specific context, the service can also be used as a real-time reliability verification service. Verify is able to identify when AI responses contain fabricated or inaccurate information.
