# OpenAI compatibility

The [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} API is highly compatible with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction){target=\_blank}'s client libraries, allowing seamless integration into your existing applications.

If you already have an application running with the OpenAI client library, you can easily switch to **kluster.ai's** API with minimal changes. This ensures a smooth transition without the need for significant refactoring or rework.

## Configuring OpenAI to use kluster.ai's API

To start using **kluster.ai** with OpenAI's client libraries, set your API key and change the base URL to `https://api.kluster.ai/v1`:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    import json

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.kluster.ai/v1",
        api_key="INSERT_API_KEY",  # Replace with your actual API key
    )
    ```

!!! abstract "Note"
    If you donâ€™t have an API key yet, you can generate one by following our [Get an API key](/get-started/get-api-key/){target=\_blank} guide.
