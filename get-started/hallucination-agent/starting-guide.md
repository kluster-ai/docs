# Hallucination Agent with kluster.ai

The kluster.ai Hallucination Agent service helps you identify when AI responses contain fabricated or inaccurate information.

With this specialized service, you can verify the factual reliability of AI-generated content and build more trustworthy applications.

The service can evaluate the AI response based on a given context which makes it great for RAG applications but can also be used as fact checking withouth providing any context.

```json
{
    "is_hallucination": boolean,
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": number,
        "prompt_tokens": number,
        "total_tokens": number
    },
    "explanation": "string",
    "search_results": []  // Only included if return_search_results is true
}
```

## What to know

AI hallucinations occur when models generate information that appears plausible but is factually incorrect or unsupported by the provided context. The kluster.ai Hallucination Agent  evaluates AI responses to determine if they contain hallucinated content, providing detailed explanations of its reasoning. The service supports both question-answer pairs and full conversation histories, giving you flexible options for verification.

This process allows you to:

- Detect when AI responses deviate from provided facts.
- Understand why a response is considered hallucinated or factual.
- Build more reliable AI systems with built-in fact-checking.
- Prevent the spread of misinformation in AI-powered applications.

Hallucination detection is particularly valuable when accuracy is critical, such as in educational tools, healthcare applications, legal assistants, or any system where factual correctness matters.

## When to use hallucination detection

The hallucination detection service is ideal for scenarios where you need:

- **Content verification** - validate AI-generated content against trusted source materials
- **Factual consistency** - ensure responses are grounded in provided context
- **Risk mitigation** - prevent misleading or fabricated information in sensitive applications
- **Quality assurance** - implement automated checks for AI response accuracy
- **Educational tools** - develop learning applications that provide factually correct information

## Benefits of hallucination detection

Detecting and preventing hallucinations delivers several key advantages:

- **Enhanced reliability** - build AI systems users can trust for critical tasks
- **Reduced misinformation** - prevent the spread of incorrect or fabricated information
- **Quality control** - implement automated verification in your AI pipeline
- **Transparent reasoning** - understand why content is flagged as hallucinated
- **Contextual awareness** - ensure AI responses remain grounded in provided facts

## How it works

The kluster.ai hallucination detection service evaluates AI outputs using a specialized judge model.

It returns `is_hallucination=true/false`, `explanation` with the reasoning and optionally can return the `serach_results`(optional) used.

## Available detection methods

kluster.ai offers two ways to detect hallucinations, each designed for different use cases:

-   <span class="badge guide">Guide</span> __Chat Completion Detection__

    ---

    Validate responses in full conversation histories using the same format as the chat completions API. Best for detecting hallucinations within context.
