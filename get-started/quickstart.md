---

# Start using the kluster.ai API

The kluster.ai API provides a straightforward way to work with Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale. It is compatible with OpenAI Python library and Batch API, making it easy to integrate into your existing workflows with minimal code changes.

Choose your preferred way to interact with the API:

- Use the [OpenAI Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python){target=\_blank} (recommended)
- Make direct HTTP requests using curl
- Use any HTTP client that supports REST APIs

This guide provides copy-and-paste examples for both Python and curl, along with detailed explanations to help you get started quickly.

The OpenAI Python library (version 1.0.0 or higher) is recommended, which can be installed with:

```bash
pip install "openai>=1.0.0"
```

## Get your API key

Navigate to the [platform.kluster.ai](http://platform.kluster.ai){target=\_blank} web app and select **API Keys** from the left-hand menu. Create a new API key by specifying the API key name. You'll need this for all API requests.

For step-by-step instructions, refer to the [Generate your kluster.ai API key](/get-started/get-api-key){target=\_blank} guide.

## Batch job workflow overview

Working with Batch jobs in the kluster.ai API involves the following steps:

1. **Create Batch job files** - structure your Batch requests as JSON files with the required details
2. **Upload Batch files** - send your JSON files to the API and receive a file ID for reference
3. **Submit the Batch job** - use the file ID to start a new Batch job
4. **Monitor Job progress** - track the status of your Batch job to ensure it is completed successfully
5. **Retrieve results** - after the job finishes, access and process the results as needed

This streamlined process enables efficient handling of large-scale requests.

## Create Batch jobs as JSON files

To take the first step in the Batch job workflow, you'll need to assemble your Batch requests and add them to a [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) file (`.jsonl`).

Each request needs to include the following arguments:

- `custom_id` ++"string"++ - a unique request ID that will be used to match outputs to inputs
- `method` ++"string"++ - the HTTP method to be used for the request. Currently, only `POST` is supported
- `url` ++"string"++ -  the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- `body` ++"object"++ - a request body containing:
    - `model` ++"string"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span> - name of the `model` to use, can be one of:
        - `klusterai/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo`
        - `klusterai/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo`
        - `klusterai/Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo`

        !!! tip
            You can see the full list of available models programmatically using the [list supported models](#list-supported-models) endpoint.

    - `messages` ++"array"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span> - a list of chat messages (`system`, `user`, or `assistant` roles)
    - Any optional [chat completion parameters](/api-reference/chat/#create-chat-completion){target=\_blank}, such as `temperature`, `max_completion_tokens`, etc.

The following examples generate requests and save them in a JSONL file, ready for upload and processing.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI
    import json

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.kluster.ai/v1",
        api_key="INSERT_API_KEY",  # Replace with your actual API key
    )

    requests = [

        # Additional tasks can be added here
    ]

    # Save tasks to a JSONL file (newline-delimited JSON)
    file_name = "mybatchtest.jsonl"
    with open(file_name, "w") as file:
        for request in requests:
            file.write(json.dumps(request) + "\n")
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash
    cat << EOF > mybatchtest.jsonl
    {"custom_id": "request-1", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "klusterai/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of Argentina?"}],"max_completion_tokens":1000}}

    EOF
    ```

## Upload Batch job files

Upload your [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/){target=\_blank} file to the `files` endpoint along with the intended purpose of the upload. For Batch jobs, set the `purpose` value to `"batch"`.

The response will contain an `id` field; save this value as you'll need it in the next step, where it's referred to as `input_file_id`.

!!! note
    You can also view all your uploaded files in the [**Files** tab](https://platform.kluster.ai/files){target=\_blank} of the kluster.ai platform.

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example request"

    batch_input_file = client.files.create(
        file=open(file_name, "rb"),
        purpose="batch"
    )
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/files \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
        -F "file=@mybatchtest.jsonl" \
        -F "purpose=batch"
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "myfile-123",
    "bytes": 2797,
    "created_at": "1733832768",
    "filename": "mybatchtest.jsonl",
    "object": "file",
    "purpose": "batch"
}
```

## Submit a Batch job

Next, submit a Batch job by calling the `batches` endpoint and providing the `id` of the uploaded Batch job file (from the previous section) as the [`input_file_id`, and additional parameters](/api-reference/batch/#submit-a-batch-job){target=\_blank} to specify the job's configuration.

The response includes an `id` that can be used to monitor the job's progress, as demonstrated in the next section.

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example request"

    batch_request = client.batches.create(
        input_file_id=batch_input_file.id,
        endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
        completion_window="24h",
    )
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
        "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
        "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
        "completion_window": "24h"
        }'
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "created_at": 1733832777,
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "status": "validating",
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": null,
    "completed_at": null,
    "error_file_id": null,
    "errors": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "expires_at": 1733919177,
    "failed_at": null,
    "finalizing_at": null,
    "in_progress_at": null,
    "metadata": {},
    "output_file_id": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "completed": 0,
        "failed": 0,
        "total": 0
    }
}
```

## Monitor job progress

To monitor your Batch job's progress, make periodic requests to the `batches` endpoint using the `id` of the Batch request (from the previous section) as the [`batch_id`](/api-reference/batch/#retrieve-a-batch){target=\_blank} to check its status. The job is complete when the `status` field returns `"completed"`.

To see a complete list of the supported statuses, refer to the [Retrieve a batch](/api-reference/batch/#retrieve-a-batch){target=\_blank} API reference page.

!!! note
    You can also monitor jobs in the [**Batch** tab](https://platform.kluster.ai/batch) of the kluster.ai platform UI.

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example request"
    import time

    # Poll the Batch status until it's complete
    while True:
        batch_status = client.batches.retrieve(batch_request.id)
        print("Batch status: {}".format(batch_status.status))
        print(
            f"Completed tasks: {batch_status.request_counts.completed} / {batch_status.request_counts.total}"
        )

        if batch_status.status.lower() in ["completed", "failed", "cancelled"]:
            break

        time.sleep(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds before checking again
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches/mybatch-123 \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors": null,
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "status": "completed",
    "output_file_id": "myfile-123-output",
    "error_file_id": null,
    "created_at": "1733832777",
    "in_progress_at": "1733832777",
    "expires_at": "1733919177",
    "finalizing_at": "1733832781",
    "completed_at": "1733832781",
    "failed_at": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": null,
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "total": 4,
        "completed": 4,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "metadata": {}
}
```

## Retrieve results

To retrieve the content of your Batch jobs output file, send a request to the `files` endpoint specifying the `output_file_id`, which is returned from querying the Batch's status (from the previous section).

The output file will be a JSONL file, where each line contains the `custom_id` from your input file request and the corresponding response.

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example request"
    # Check if the Batch completed successfully
    if batch_status.status.lower() == "completed":
        # Retrieve the results
        result_file_id = batch_status.output_file_id
        results = client.files.content(result_file_id).content

        # Save results to a file
        result_file_name = "batch_results.jsonl"
        with open(result_file_name, "wb") as file:
            file.write(results)
        print(f"Results saved to {result_file_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Batch failed with status: {batch_status.status}")
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/files/kluster-output-file-123/content \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" > batch_output.jsonl
    ```

## List all Batch jobs

To list all of your Batch jobs, send a request to the `batches` endpoint without specifying a `batch_id`. To constrain the query response, you can also use a `limit` parameter.

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example request"
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Configure OpenAI client
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.kluster.ai/v1", 
        api_key="INSERT_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual API key
    )

    print(client.batches.list(limit=2).to_dict())
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request" 
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
"object": "list",
"data": [
    {
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors": null,
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "status": "completed",
    "output_file_id": "myfile-123-output",
    "error_file_id": null,
    "created_at": "1733832777",
    "in_progress_at": "1733832777",
    "expires_at": "1733919177",
    "finalizing_at": "1733832781",
    "completed_at": "1733832781",
    "failed_at": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": null,
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "total": 4,
        "completed": 4,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "metadata": {}
    },
{ ... },
],
"first_id": "mybatch-123",
"last_id": "mybatch-789",
"has_more": false,
"count": 1,
"page": 1,
"page_count": -1,
"items_per_page": 9223372036854775807
}
```

## Cancel a Batch job

To cancel a Batch job currently in progress, send a request to the `cancel` endpoint with your `batch_id`. Note that cancellation may take up to 10 minutes to complete, during which time the status will show as `cancelling`. Once complete, the status will show as `cancelled`.

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example"
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.kluster.ai/v1",  
        api_key="INSERT_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual API key
    )
    client.batches.cancel("mybatch-123") # Replace with your Batch id
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches/$BATCH_ID/cancel \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -X POST
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors": null,
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "status": "cancelling",
    "output_file_id": "myfile-123-output",
    "error_file_id": null,
    "created_at": "1730821906",
    "in_progress_at": "1730821911",
    "expires_at": "1730821906",
    "finalizing_at": null,
    "completed_at": null,
    "failed_at": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": "1730821906",
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "total": 3,
        "completed": 3,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "metadata": {}
}
```
