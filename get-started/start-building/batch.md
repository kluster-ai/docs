# Perform batch inference jobs

## Overview

This guide provides examples and instructions on how to create, submit, retrieve, and manage batch inference jobs using the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} API. You will find guidance about preparing your data, selecting a model, submitting your batch job, and retrieving your results.
 
## Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with basic Python and Large Language Model (LLM) development. Before getting started, make sure you have:

- **An active kluster API key** - if you don't already have one, see the [Get an API key](/get-started/get-api-key/){target=\_blank} guide for instructions
- **A basic understanding of** [**JSON Lines (JSONL)**](https://jsonlines.org/){target=\_blank} - JSONL is the required text input format for performing batch inferences with the kluster.ai API
- **A virtual Python environment** - this optional but recommended step helps isolate Python installations in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/){target=\_blank} to reduce the risk of environment or package conflicts between your projects

## Supported models

Batch inference using kluster.ai supports the following models:

--8<-- 'text/batch-models.md'

In addition, you can see the complete list of available models programmatically using the [list supported models](/api-reference/reference/#list-supported-models){target=\_blank} endpoint.

## Batch job workflow overview

Working with batch jobs in the kluster.ai API involves the following steps:

1. **Create batch job file** - prepare a JSON Lines file containing one or more chat completion requests to execute in the batch
2. **Upload batch job file** - upload the file to kluster.ai to receive a unique file ID
3. **Start the batch job** - initiate a new batch job using the file ID
4. **Monitor job progress** - track the status of your batch job to ensure successful completion
5. **Retrieve results** - once the job finishes, access and process the results as needed

This streamlined process enables efficient handling of large-scale requests.

In addition to these core steps, this guide will give you hands-on experience to:

- **Cancel a batch job** - cancel an ongoing batch job before it completes
- **List all batch jobs** - review all of your batch jobs

## Create batch jobs as JSON files

To begin the batch job workflow, you'll need to assemble your batch requests and add them to a [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) file (`.jsonl`).

Each request must include the following arguments:

- `custom_id` ++"string"++ - a unique request ID to match outputs to inputs
- `method` ++"string"++ - the HTTP method to use for the request. Currently, only `POST` is supported
- `url` ++"string"++ -  the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- `body` ++"object"++ - a request body containing:
    - `model` ++"string"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span> - name of one of the [supported models](#supported-models)
    - `messages` ++"array"++ <span class="required" markdown>++"required"++</span> - a list of chat messages (`system`, `user`, or `assistant` roles)
    - Any optional [chat completion parameters](/api-reference/reference/#create-chat-completion){target=\_blank}, such as `temperature`, `max_completion_tokens`, etc.

The following examples generate requests and save them in a JSONL file, which is ready for upload and processing. Options are included for Python and CLI commands. 

=== "Python"

    ```python
    --8<-- 'code/get-started/integrations/start-building/batch/batch-jsonl-01.py'
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    --8<-- 'code/get-started/integrations/start-building/batch/batch-jsonl-02.txt'
    ```

## Upload batch job files

Upload your [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/){target=\_blank} file to the `files` endpoint along with the intended purpose of the upload. Set the `purpose` value to `"batch"` for batch jobs.

The response will contain an `id` field; save this value as you'll need it in the next step, where it's referred to as `input_file_id`. You can view your uploaded files in the [**Files** tab](https://platform.kluster.ai/files){target=\_blank} of the kluster.ai platform.

Use the following Python script or curl command examples to upload your batch job files:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    batch_input_file = client.files.create(
        file=open(file_name, "rb"),
        purpose="batch"
    )
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/files \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
        -F "file=@mybatchtest.jsonl" \
        -F "purpose=batch"
    ```


```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "myfile-123",
    "bytes": 2797,
    "created_at": "1733832768",
    "filename": "mybatchtest.jsonl",
    "object": "file",
    "purpose": "batch"
}
```

## Submit a batch job

Next, submit a batch job by calling the `batches` endpoint and providing the `id` of the uploaded batch job file (from the previous section) as the [`input_file_id`, and additional parameters](/api-reference/reference/#submit-a-batch-job){target=\_blank} to specify the job's configuration.

The response includes an `id` that can be used to monitor the job's progress, as demonstrated in the next section.

Use the following Python script or curl command examples to submit your batch job:

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example request"

    batch_request = client.batches.create(
        input_file_id=batch_input_file.id,
        endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
        completion_window="24h",
    )
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
        "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
        "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
        "completion_window": "24h"
        }'
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "created_at": 1733832777,
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "status": "validating",
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": null,
    "completed_at": null,
    "error_file_id": null,
    "errors": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "expires_at": 1733919177,
    "failed_at": null,
    "finalizing_at": null,
    "in_progress_at": null,
    "metadata": {},
    "output_file_id": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "completed": 0,
        "failed": 0,
        "total": 0
 }
}
```

## Monitor job progress

You can make periodic requests to the `batches` endpoint to monitor your batch job's progress. Use the `id` of the batch request from the preceding section as the [`batch_id`](/api-reference/reference/#retrieve-a-batch){target=\_blank} to check its status. The job is complete when the `status` field returns `"completed"`. You can also monitor jobs in the [**Batch** tab](https://platform.kluster.ai/batch) of the kluster.ai platform UI.

To see a complete list of the supported statuses, refer to the [Retrieve a batch](/api-reference/reference/#retrieve-a-batch){target=\_blank} API reference page.

Use the following Python script or curl command examples to monitor the progress of your batch job:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    --8<-- 'code/get-started/integrations/start-building/batch/batch-jsonl-03.py'
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches/mybatch-123 \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```


```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors": null,
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "status": "completed",
    "output_file_id": "myfile-123-output",
    "error_file_id": null,
    "created_at": "1733832777",
    "in_progress_at": "1733832777",
    "expires_at": "1733919177",
    "finalizing_at": "1733832781",
    "completed_at": "1733832781",
    "failed_at": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": null,
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "total": 4,
        "completed": 4,
        "failed": 0
 },
    "metadata": {}
}
```

## Retrieve results

To retrieve the content of your batch jobs output file, send a request to the `files` endpoint specifying the `output_file_id`, which is returned from querying the batch's status (from the previous section).

The output file will be a JSONL file, where each line contains the `custom_id` from your input file request and the corresponding response.

Use the following Python script or curl command examples to retrieve results from your batch job:

=== "Python"

    ```python 
    --8<-- 'code/get-started/integrations/start-building/batch/batch-jsonl-04.py'
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/files/kluster-output-file-123/content \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" > batch_output.jsonl
    ```

## List all batch jobs

To list all of your batch jobs, send a request to the `batches` endpoint without specifying a `batch_id`. To constrain the query response, you can also use a `limit` parameter.

Use the following Python script or curl command examples to list all of your batch jobs:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Configure OpenAI client
    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.kluster.ai/v1", 
        api_key="INSERT_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual API key
    )

    print(client.batches.list(limit=2).to_dict())
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example request" 
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
"object": "list",
"data": [
    {
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors": null,
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "status": "completed",
    "output_file_id": "myfile-123-output",
    "error_file_id": null,
    "created_at": "1733832777",
    "in_progress_at": "1733832777",
    "expires_at": "1733919177",
    "finalizing_at": "1733832781",
    "completed_at": "1733832781",
    "failed_at": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": null,
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "total": 4,
        "completed": 4,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "metadata": {}
    },
{ ... },
],
"first_id": "mybatch-123",
"last_id": "mybatch-789",
"has_more": false,
"count": 1,
"page": 1,
"page_count": -1,
"items_per_page": 9223372036854775807
}
```

## Cancel a batch job

To cancel a batch job currently in progress, send a request to the `cancel` endpoint with your `batch_id`. Note that cancellation may take up to 10 minutes to complete, when the status will show as `cancelling`. Once complete, the status will show as `cancelled`.

Use the following Python script or curl command examples to cancel a batch job:

=== "Python"

    ```python title="Example"
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.kluster.ai/v1",  
        api_key="INSERT_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual API key
    )
    client.batches.cancel("mybatch-123") # Replace with your Batch id
    ```

=== "curl"

    ```bash title="Example"
    curl -s https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches/$BATCH_ID/cancel \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -X POST
    ```

```Json title="Response"
{
    "id": "mybatch-123",
    "object": "batch",
    "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors": null,
    "input_file_id": "myfile-123",
    "completion_window": "24h",
    "status": "cancelling",
    "output_file_id": "myfile-123-output",
    "error_file_id": null,
    "created_at": "1730821906",
    "in_progress_at": "1730821911",
    "expires_at": "1730821906",
    "finalizing_at": null,
    "completed_at": null,
    "failed_at": null,
    "expired_at": null,
    "cancelling_at": "1730821906",
    "cancelled_at": null,
    "request_counts": {
        "total": 3,
        "completed": 3,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "metadata": {}
}
```
