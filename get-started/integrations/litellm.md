# Integrate LiteLLM with kluster.ai

[LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/){target=_blank} is an open-source Python library that streamlines access to a broad range of Large Language Model (LLM) providers through a standardized interface inspired by the OpenAI format. By providing features like fallback mechanisms, cost tracking, and streaming support, LiteLLM reduces the complexity of working with different models, ensuring a more reliable and cost-effective approach to AI-driven applications.

Integrating LiteLLM with the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} API enables the use of kluster.ai's powerful models alongside LiteLLM's flexible orchestration. This combination makes it simple to switch between models on the fly, handle token usage limits with context window fallback, and monitor usage costs in real-timeâ€”leading to robust, scalable, and adaptable AI workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

--8<-- 'text/kluster-api-onboarding.md'
- **[A python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/){target=\_blank}** - this is optional but recommended. Ensure that you enter the Python virtual environment before following along with this tutorial
- [**LiteLLM installed**](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm){target=\_blank} - to install the library, use the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install litellm
    ```

## Configure LiteLLM

In this section, you'll learn how to integrate kluster.ai with LiteLLM. You'll configure your environment variables, specify a kluster.ai model, and make a simple request using LiteLLM's OpenAI-like interface.

1. **Import LiteLLM and its dependencies** - create a new file (e.g., `hello-litellm.py`) and start by importing the necessary Python modules:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/hello-litellm.py::04"
```
2. **Set your kluster.ai API key and Base URL** - replace INSERT_API_KEY with your actual API key. If you don't have one yet, refer to the [Get an API key](/get-started/get-api-key/){target=\_blank} guide
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/hello-litellm.py:05:08"
```
3. **Define your conversation (system + user messages)** - set up your initial system prompt and user message. The system message defines your AI assistant's role, while the user message is the actual question or prompt
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/hello-litellm.py:09:13"
```
4. **Select your kluster.ai model** - choose one of [kluster.ai's available models](/get-started/models/){target=\_blank} that best fits your use case. Prepend the model name with `openai/` so LiteLLM recognizes it as an OpenAI-like model request
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/hello-litellm.py:15:16"
```
5. **Call the LiteLLM completion function** - finally, invoke the completion function to send your request:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/hello-litellm.py:18:24"
```

??? code "View complete script"
    ```python title="hello-litellm.py"
    --8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/hello-litellm.py"
    ```

Use the following command to run your script:

```python
python hello-litellm.py
```

--8<-- 'code/get-started/integrations/litellm/terminal/hello-litellm-output.md'

That's it! You've successfully integrated LiteLLM with the kluster.ai API. Continue to learn how to experiment with more advanced features of LiteLLM.

## Explore LiteLLM features

In the previous section, you learned how to use LiteLLM with the kluster.ai API by properly configuring the model via an OpenAI-like call and configuring the API key and API base URL. The following sections demonstrate using LiteLLM's streaming response and multi-turn conversation features with the kluster.ai API.

The following guide assumes you just finished the configuration exercise in the preceding section. If you haven't already done so, please complete the configuration steps in the [Configure LiteLLM](#configure-litellm) section before you continue.

### Use streaming responses

You can enable streaming by simply passing `stream=True` to the `completion()` function. Streaming returns a generator instead of a static response, letting you iterate over partial output chunks as they arrive. In the code sample below, each chunk is accessed in a for-in loop, allowing you to extract the textual content (e.g., `chunk.choices[0].delta.content)` rather than printing all metadata.

To configure a streaming response, take the following steps:

1. **Update the `messages` system prompt and first user message** - you can supply a user message or use the sample provided:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:13:16"
```

2. **Initiate a streaming request to the model** - set `stream=True` in the `completion()` function to tell LiteLLM to return partial pieces (chunks) of the response as they become available rather than waiting for the entire response to be ready
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:18:32"
```
3. **Isolate the returned text content** - returning all of the streamed data will include a lot of excessive noise like token counts, etc. You can isolate the text content from the rest of the streamed response with the following code:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:34:42"
```

### Handle multi-turn conversation

LiteLLM can facilitate multi-turn conversations by maintaining message history in a sequential chain, enabling the model to consider the context of previous messages. This section demonstrates multi-turn conversation handling by updating the messages list each time we receive a new response from the assistant. This pattern can be repeated for as many turns as you need, continuously appending messages to maintain the conversational flow.

Let's take a closer look at each step:

1. **Combine the streamed chunks of the first message** - since the message is streamed in chunks, you must re-assemble them into a single message. After collecting partial responses in `streamed_text`, join them into a single string called `complete_first_answer`:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:44:45"
```
2. **Append the assistant's reply** - to enhance the context of the conversation. Add `complete_first_answer` back into messages under the "assistant" role as follows:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:47:48"
```
3. **Craft the second message to the assistant** - append a new message object to messages with the user's next question as follows:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:50:57"
```
4. **Ask the model to respond to the second question** - this time, don't enable the streaming feature. Pass the updated messages to `completion()` with `stream=False`, prompting LiteLLM to generate a standard (single-shot) response as follows:
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:59:69"
```
5. **Parse and print the second answer** - extract `response_2.choices[0].message["content"]`, store it in `second_answer_text`, and print to the console for your final output: 
```python
--8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py:71:76"
```

You can view the full script below. It demonstrates a streamed response versus a regular response and how to handle a multi-turn conversation.  

??? code "View complete script"
    ```python title="hello-litellm.py"
    --8<-- "code/get-started/integrations/litellm/litellm-features.py"
    ```

## Put it all together

Use the following command to run your script:
```bash
python hello-litellm.py
```

You should see output that resembles the following:

--8<-- 'code/get-started/integrations/litellm/terminal/output.md'

Both responses appear to trail off abruptly, but that's because we limited the output to `300` tokens each. Feel free to tweak the parameters and rerun the script at your leisure!
