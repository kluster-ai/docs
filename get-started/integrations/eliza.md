# Using eliza with the kluster.ai API

[eliza](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/){target=\_blank} is an open-source framework designed to create and manage AI agents that can handle a variety of tasks, from simple chat interactions to more complex automation.

In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/) into eliza so you can leverage its powerful models and quickly set up your AI-driven workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following kluster prerequisites:

- **A kluster.ai account** - sign up on the [kluster.ai platform](https://platform.kluster.ai/signup){target=\_blank} if you don't have one
- **A kluster.ai API key** - after signing in, go to the [**API Keys**](https://platform.kluster.ai/apikeys){target=\_blank} section and create a new key. For detailed instructions, check out the [Get an API key](/get-started/get-api-key/){target=\_blank} guide

Next, you can clone and install the eliza repository by following the installation instructions on the [eliza Quick Start guide](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart/){target=\_blank}. Pay careful attention to the eliza prerequisites, including the minimum supported versions of Node.js and pnpm. You can pause at the **Configure Environment** section in the Quick Start guide, as those steps will be addressed in this guide.

## Configure your environment

After you have eliza installed, it's simple to utilize kluster.ai with eliza. Only three main changes to the `.env` file are required. You can run the following command to generate a `.env` file from the provided example. 

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, set the following variables in the `.env` file: 

  - **OPENAI_API_KEY** - replace `INSERT_API_KEY` in the code below with your own kluster.ai API key. If you don't have one yet, refer to the [Get an API key guide](/get-started/get-api-key/){target=\_blank}
  - **OPENAI_API_URL** - use `https://api.kluster.ai/v1` to send requests to the kluster.ai endpoint
  - **OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL** - choose one of kluster.ai's available models based on your use case. Ensure that the model's full name starting with `klusterai/` is listed. For more details, see [kluster.aiâ€™s models](/api-reference/reference/#list-supported-models){target=\_blank}

The OpenAI configuration section of your `.env` file should resemble the following:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=INSERT_KLUSTER_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.kluster.ai/v1

# Community Plugin for OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL=klusterai/Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo
```

## Run and interact with your first agent

Now that you've configured your environment properly you're ready to run your first agent! eliza comes with a number of characters that you can interact with by prompting or that can autonomously perform tasks like tweeting. This guide relies on the `Dobby` character for its minimal setup requirements. Other agents, particularly those that handle tweets, would necessitate additional steps, such as X login and similar information. 

By default, `Dobby` uses the `openai` model, which has been properly configured to rely on the kluster.ai API, but it doesn't hurt to double-check the `dobby.character.json` file under the `characters` folder. You should see the configuration start with the following:

```json
{
    "name": "Dobby",
    "clients": [],
    "modelProvider": "openai",
```

To run the `Dobby` agent, run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
pnpm start --character="characters/dobby.character.json"
``` 

In another terminal window, run the following command to launch the web UI: 

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

You can now interact with Dobby by clicking on the **Chat** button and starting the conversation:

That's it! You've successfully integrated eliza with the kluster.ai API. You're now ready to harness the power of AI agents with the kluster.ai API!
