# How to integrate SillyTavern with kluster.ai

[SillyTavern](https://sillytavernai.com/){target=\_blank} is a locally installed customizable LLM user interface that focuses on persona-driven LLM interactionsâ€”letting you create unique characters or group chats for tasks like code reviews and text editing. It provides custom prompt fields, bookmarks for revisiting specific points in a conversation, and a mobile-friendly design to manage your chat sessions easily.

By integrating SillyTavern with the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} API, you can tap into kluster.ai's high-performance language models as your primary or backup backend. This combination merges SillyTavern's customizable UI and advanced prompt options with kluster.ai's reliable inference, offering a scalable and tailored chat environment for casual users and AI enthusiasts.
