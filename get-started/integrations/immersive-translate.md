# Integrate Immersive Translate with kluster.ai

[Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/){target=_blank} is an  AI-powered bilingual translation extension that automatically identifies the main text on any web page and provides parallel translations in real-time. This context-driven approach streamlines reading and collaboration across languages with additional features like efficient document translation, hover translation, and support for 10+ translation services.

In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate Immersive Translate with the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=_blank} API—from installation through configuration—so you can seamlessly handle multilingual content within your workflows. You will enable Immersive Translate's core capabilities with kluster.ai's powerful models, helping you build more robust and accessible AI-driven applications.

1. Click on the **Translation Services** section of settings
2. Toggle the switch to enable kluster.ai as a provider

That's it! The next section will demonstrate using Immersive Translate with the kluster.ai API to perform webpage translations.

## Translate content

With Immersive Translate, you can easily translate content with just a few clicks. To do so, navigate to the page with the foreign language content. Open the Immersive Translate plugin and take the following steps:

1. The language of the existing content is auto-detected by the plugin, but it's a good idea to verify it
2. Select the language to translate the content into. This is set by default to your native language 
3. Press **Translate**
