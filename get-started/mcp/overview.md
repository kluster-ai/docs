# MCP Integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. Think of it as the "USB-C port for AI applications" â€“ a universal way to plug different capabilities into your AI workflows.

## What is MCP?

MCP standardizes how AI applications access:

- **Local data**: Files, databases, and services on your computer
- **Remote services**: APIs, web services, and cloud resources  
- **Custom tools**: Specialized functions for your specific needs

With MCP, you can switch between AI providers while keeping the same tool integrations, similar to how USB-C works across different devices.

## Why kluster Supports MCP

kluster embraces MCP to help developers build more capable AI applications. By providing pre-built MCP servers, kluster makes it easy to add specialized capabilities to any MCP-compatible environment like Claude Desktop, VS Code, or automation platforms.

## Example: kluster verify MCP Server

As an example of MCP in action, kluster offers a verify MCP server that adds reliability checking capabilities to your AI assistant. This server provides two specialized tools:

**`fact_check`**: Verify any statement against reliable sources
**`document_claim_check`**: Verify claims about uploaded documents

This is just one example of how MCP can extend AI capabilities. The protocol supports any type of tool or data integration you need.

## How MCP Works

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

1. **MCP Hosts**: Your AI application (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
2. **MCP Servers**: Programs that expose specific capabilities
3. **Protocol**: Standardized communication between hosts and servers
4. **Tools**: Functions that servers provide to AI assistants

## Available MCP Implementations

kluster currently offers the verify MCP server, with more implementations planned:

## Getting Started with MCP

To use any MCP server with your AI application:

1. **Choose an MCP-compatible client** (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
2. **Select an MCP server** that provides the tools you need
3. **Configure the connection** in your client settings
4. **Start using the tools** in your AI conversations
