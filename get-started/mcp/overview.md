# MCP integration

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction){target=\_blank} (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to specialized tools. Think of it as "USB-C for AI" - one protocol that works everywhere, enabling seamless integration between AI applications and external capabilities.

[kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} provides MCP servers that bring AI services directly into your development workflow. Choose between a managed cloud endpoint or self-hosted deployment for seamless integration across platforms.

## What is MCP?

MCP lets AI applications access external capabilities:

- **Local tools**: Files, databases, custom functions.
- **Remote services**: APIs, web services, cloud resources.
- **Specialized features**: Like kluster.ai's verification technology.

## MCP through kluster.ai services

Instead of managing API calls and integrations, access kluster.ai's AI capabilities as native tools in Claude desktop, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible platforms.

The kluster.ai MCP offers the [Verify service](/get-started/verify/reliability/overview){target=\_blank} through two deployment options designed for different use cases and platforms.

### Cloud MCP

Managed cloud implementation - no infrastructure to maintain:

Enable your endpoint through the kluster.ai platform, get your MCP token, and start verifying. Works with any MCP client using standard connection patterns.

### Self-hosted MCP

Same verification tools running on your infrastructure with full control. Deploy locally with Docker or Node.js.
