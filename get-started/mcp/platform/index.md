# Platform MCP

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    Platform MCP is currently under development. This page will be updated when the service becomes available.

Platform MCP will provide cloud-hosted endpoints for reliability verification, designed for no-code and low-code platforms. Unlike Self-hosted MCP, Platform MCP will handle all infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on building your applications.

## Planned Features

- **Managed infrastructure**: No servers to maintain or Docker containers to run
- **Web-based configuration**: Enable/disable tools through a simple interface
- **SSE endpoints**: Compatible with platforms supporting URL-based integrations
- **API key management**: Generate and manage keys directly from the platform
- **Usage analytics**: Track verification requests and token consumption

## Who Is This For?

Platform MCP will be ideal for:

- **No-code platforms**: Integrate without technical setup
- **Low-code developers**: Focus on logic, not infrastructure
- **Enterprise teams**: Centralized management and billing
- **Quick prototypes**: Start verifying in minutes
