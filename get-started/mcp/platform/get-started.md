# Platform MCP

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    Platform MCP is currently under development. This page will be updated when the service becomes available.

Platform MCP will provide cloud-hosted tool. Unlike self-hosted MCP, platform MCP will handle all infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on building your applications.

## Planned features

- **Managed infrastructure**: No servers to maintain or Docker containers to run.
- **Web-based configuration**: Enable/disable tools through a simple interface.
- **SSE endpoints**: Compatible with platforms supporting URL-based integrations.
- **API key management**: Generate and manage keys directly from the platform.


## Who is this for?

Platform MCP will be ideal for:

- **No-code platforms**: Integrate without technical setup.
- **Low-code developers**: Focus on logic, not infrastructure.
- **Quick prototypes**: Start verifying in minutes.
