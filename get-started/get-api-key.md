    - **Keep it secret** - do not share your API key publicly or commit it to version control systems
    - **Use environment variables** - store your API key in environment variables instead of hardcoding them
    - **Regenerate if compromised** - if you suspect your API key has been exposed, regenerate it immediately from the **API Keys** section

## Managing your API keys

You can create, view, and delete API keys by navigating to the [**API Keys**](https://platform.kluster.ai/apikeys){target=\_blank} section. Your API keys will be listed in the **API Key Management** section.

To delete an API key, take the following steps:

1. Locate the API key you wish to delete in the list
2. Click the trash bin icon ( :octicons-trash-24: ) in the **Actions** column
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted
