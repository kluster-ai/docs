## List all Batch jobs

`GET https://api.kluster.ai/v1/batches`

To list all Batch jobs, send a request to the `batches` endpoint without specifying a `batch_id`. To constrain the query response, you can also use a `limit` parameter.

<div class="grid" markdown>
<div markdown>

**Query parameters**

`after` ++"string"++

A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.

---

`limit` ++"integer"++

A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100. Default is 20.

---

**Returns**

A list of paginated [Batch](#batch-object) objects.

The status of a Batch object can be one of the following:

<style>
table th:first-child {
  width: 10em;
}
</style>

| Status        | Description                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `validating`  | The input file is being validated.                                      |
| `failed`      | The input file failed the validation process.                           |
| `in_progress` | The input file was successfully validated and the Batch is in progress. |
| `finalising`  | The Batch job has completed and the results are being finalized.        |
| `completed`   | The Batch has completed and the results are ready.                      |
| `expired`     | The Batch was not completed within the 24-hour time window.             |
| `cancelling`  | The Batch is being cancelled (may take up to 10 minutes).               |
| `cancelled`   | The Batch was cancelled.                                                |
