<span data-ty=>Question 1: Hello! Can you tell me something interesting about the city of Kathmandu?</span>
<span data-ty>Response 1: Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is indeed a treasure trove of history, culture, and natural beauty. Here's something interesting:</span>
<span data-ty>Kathmandu is home to the famous Boudhanath Stupa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's one of the largest Buddhist stupas in the world and is considered a sacred site by Buddhists. The stupa is over 36 meters (118 feet) high and is built in a unique octagonal shape. Its massive size is so prominent that it can be seen from many parts of the city.</span>
<span data-ty>Another fascinating fact is that Kathmandu has managed to conserve its rich cultural heritage, which dates back to the 12th century. You can see ancient temples, palaces, streets, and marketplaces that have been beautifully preserved and restored.</span>
<span data-ty>Lastly, Kathmandu is also known for its Newar culture, which is the indigenous culture of the city. The Newars have a rich tradition of art, music, and cuisine, which is reflected in the vibrant festivals and celebrations that take place throughout the year.</span>

<span data-ty>Question 2: What is the population of that city?</span>
<span data-ty>Response 2: Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, has a population of around 374,405 people (as per the 2021 estimates). However, the Kathmandu Valley, which includes the surrounding municipalities and areas, has a population of over 3.2 million people.</span>
<span data-ty>When considering the larger metropolitan area that includes the neighboring cities like Lalitpur (Patan) and Bhaktapur, the population exceeds 5 million people, making it one of the largest urban agglomerations in Nepal.</span>
<span data-ty>It's worth noting that Nepal's population density is relatively high, with many people living in urban areas. The Kathmandu Valley, in particular, is one of the most densely populated regions in the country.</span>
