# How to use activation codes

Activation codes provide promotional credits for [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=_blank} plans. This guide shows you how to redeem your activation code and apply it to your subscription.

## Prerequisites

Before redeeming an activation code, ensure you have:

- A kluster.ai account. If you don't have one, [create an account](https://platform.kluster.ai/signup){target=_blank}.
- An activation code that matches the plan you want to subscribe to.

## Redeeming your activation code

Follow these steps to redeem your activation code:

1. Log in to your [kluster.ai account](https://platform.kluster.ai){target=_blank}. After logging in, you'll receive 50 free code reviews under the trial plan.

2. Click the **upgrade** button in the top right corner of the platform.

## Troubleshooting

### Code not working

If your activation code doesn't work:

- Verify the code matches your selected plan (Starter, Team, or Enterprise).
- Check that the code hasn't expired.
- Ensure you haven't already used this code on your account.

### Plan mismatch

Activation codes are plan-specific. If you receive an error, confirm your code is valid for the plan you selected.
