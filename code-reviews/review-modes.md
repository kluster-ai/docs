# Code Reviews

Code Reviews analyzes your code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and quality issues. It works in two modes: **Vibe Coding** for AI-assisted workflows, and **Manual Coding** for on-demand reviews directly in your editor.

The service integrates directly into your IDE or CLI (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Claude Code, and others), analyzing code as you work.

## Key features

- **Flexible review modes**: Vibe Coding for AI-assisted workflows, Manual Coding for direct editor reviews.
- **Comprehensive issue detection**: Analyzes 7 issue types — *Semantic, Intent, Logical, Security, Knowledge, Performance,* and *Quality*.
- **Customizable sensitivity**: Configure detection sensitivity from *Low* to *Critical*.
- **Dual analysis tools**: Real-time Code Review and Dependency Analysis for complete coverage.
- **Instant fixes**: Apply suggested fixes with one click, or let your AI assistant handle them automatically.

## Vibe Coding

**For AI-assisted coding workflows.**

Vibe Coding works alongside your AI coding assistant. When the AI generates or modifies code, kluster.ai automatically reviews it in real-time. You can also ask your AI to review existing files on demand.

**Vibe Coding also verifies *intent*—ensuring your AI actually did what you asked**, not just that the code works. This context-aware check is only possible when kluster.ai sees your original prompt.

- **Automatic Reviews**: Triggered automatically when AI generates code.
- **Manual Reviews**: Triggered when you ask your AI to review existing code.

**Compatible with**: Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Antigravity (IDEs) and Claude Code, Codex CLI (CLIs)

## Manual Coding

**For direct, in-editor reviews without AI.**

Manual Coding is an IDE extension that provides on-demand code reviews—no AI assistant needed. Available features include:

- **Code block review**: Review selected code snippets.
- **Current file review**: Analyze the file you're working on.
- **Uncommitted changes review**: Check all modified files before committing.

**Compatible with**: Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Antigravity (IDEs only)
