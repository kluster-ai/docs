# On-demand reviews

On-demand reviews let you ask your AI assistant to review existing code—not just newly generated code. This is useful for auditing files, checking security, or verifying code you didn't write.

## How it works

1.  **You ask**: Tell your AI to review a file or code block (e.g., "use kluster to check all my changes").
2.  **AI triggers review**: The assistant calls kluster.ai's manual review tool.
3.  **kluster.ai analyzes**: Results appear with issues and suggested fixes your AI can apply.
