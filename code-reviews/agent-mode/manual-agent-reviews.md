# Manual Reviews

Manual Reviews let you ask your AI assistant to review existing code—not just newly generated code. This is useful for auditing files, checking security, or verifying code you didn't write.

## How it works

1.  **You ask**: Tell your AI to review a file or code block (e.g., "use kluster to check all my changes").
2.  **AI triggers review**: The assistant calls kluster.ai's manual review tool.
3.  **kluster.ai analyzes**: Results appear with issues and suggested fixes your AI can apply.
