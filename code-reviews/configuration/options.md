# Options

You can customize the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=_blank} Code Reviews behavior through the platform settings or directly in your IDE. This allows you to tailor the review process to your specific needs, such as choosing between fast or deep analysis, configuring sensitivity levels for issue reporting, selecting which types of bug checks to perform, and enabling or disabling specific MCP tools to match your development workflow.

![Code Review Options interface showing three numbered sections: Sensitivity Settings, Code Review Scope, and Enabled Tools](/images/code-reviews/configuration/configuration-1.webp)

## 1. Sensitivity settings

Configure the minimum sensitivity level for Code Reviews issue reporting. Set your threshold based on your team's needs:

- `Low`: Detects even the smallest potential issues.
- `Medium`: Suitable for projects requiring strong security and high code quality.
- `High`: (Recommended) Strong protection against security and quality issues while maintaining good performance.
- `Critical`: Focuses only on critical issues for faster iteration and smoother coding experience.

The ideal setting depends on your use case. For example, a **High** level is a good starting point, but you might want to set it to **Medium** for production code.

## 2. Code review scope

Select which types of issues Code Reviews detects during code analysis. You have full control over which bug types to check for through simple on/off toggles.

|     Type      |           Description           |                Example                |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|   `intent`    | Code doesn't match user request | User asked for sorting, got filtering |
|  `semantic`   |    Meaning and type errors      |        Wrong variable type used       |
|  `knowledge`  |    Best practice violations     |       Not following conventions       |
| `performance` |       Performance issues        |        Inefficient algorithms         |
|   `quality`   |      Code quality problems      |        Poor naming, complexity        |
|   `logical`   |     Control flow errors         |           Off-by-one errors           |
|  `security`   |    Security vulnerabilities     |          SQL injection risks          |

## 3. Enabled tools

Control which review tools run in your development environment. Enable or disable each tool based on your project's specific needs and workflow.

- `Real-time Code Review`: For code quality reviews.
- `Dependency Analysis`: For package and dependency security.
- `Ambient Background Reviews (Beta, Enterprise plan)`: Automatic reviews that run in the background after you pause typing.

## 4. Analysis level

Control review depth to balance between speed and thoroughness. You can configure different analysis levels for human-driven and AI-driven development workflows.

![Analysis Level settings showing options for Human-Driven and AI-Driven Development](/images/code-reviews/configuration/configuration-analysis-level-01.webp)

- `Instant`: Completes in about five seconds. Detects most issues and is suited for fast review and iteration cycles.
- `Deep`: Takes up to a few minutes. Performs more thorough analysis to identify edge cases in critical or final reviews.

### Human-driven development

Configure analysis depth for reviews you trigger directly in your IDE:



- **When I click Review button in IDE**: Runs an on-demand review that applies to the current file, uncommitted changes, or the active branch.
- **When I type code**: Reviews code continuously as you write, automatically analyzing changes and highlighting potential issues.

### AI-driven development

Configure analysis depth for reviews triggered through AI assistants:


|:--------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
- **When AI agent writes code**: Automatically reviews code generated by an AI assistant as it is produced.
- **When I ask AI agent to review code**: Runs a review when you explicitly request a review from an AI assistant.

The default configuration applies **Deep** to human-driven reviews and **Instant** to AI-driven reviews. For critical code, **Deep** provides more thorough analysis and is better suited for final reviews and production changes, where accuracy matters more than speed.
