# Options

You can customize the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} Code Reviews behavior through the platform settings or directly in your IDE. The options page is available in the left-hand menu under **Review options**, where you can configure sensitivity levels for issue reporting, select which types of bug checks to run, and enable or disable specific MCP tools to match your development workflow.

## Sensitivity settings

Configure the minimum sensitivity level for the real-time Code Reviews issue reporting. Set your threshold based on your team's requirements:

- **Low**: Detects even the smallest potential issues.
- **Medium**: Suitable for projects requiring strong security and high code quality.
- **High**: (Recommended) Balances strong protection against LLM hallucination and security issues with performance.
- **Critical**: Focuses only on critical issues for faster iteration and smoother coding experience.

!!! info "Choosing a sensitivity level"
    The ideal setting depends on your use case. In general, a **High** level is a good starting point, but you might want to set it to **Medium** for production workflows.

## Code review scope

Select which types of issues real-time Code Review detects during analysis. Each type specifies a category of issues the system can identify.

|     Type      |           Description           |                Example                |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|   **Intent**    | Code doesn't match user request | User asked for sorting, got filtering |
|  **Semantic**   |    Meaning and type errors      |        Wrong variable type used       |
|  **Knowledge**  |    Best practice violations     |       Not following conventions       |
| **Performance** |       Performance issues        |        Inefficient algorithms         |
|   **Quality**   |      Code quality problems      |        Poor naming, complexity        |
|   **Logical**   |     Control flow errors         |           Off-by-one errors           |
|  **Security**   |    Security vulnerabilities     |          SQL injection risks          |

## Enabled tools

Control which review tools run in your development environment. Enable or disable each tool based on your project's specific needs and workflow.

- **Real-time Code Review**: For code quality reviews.
- **Dependency Analysis**: For package and dependency security.
- **Ambient Background Reviews (Beta, Enterprise plan)**: Automatic reviews that run in the background after you pause typing.

## Analysis level

Control review depth to balance between speed and thoroughness. You can configure different analysis levels for human-driven and AI-driven development workflows.

### Human-driven development

Configure analysis depth for reviews you trigger directly in your IDE:

- **When I click Review button in IDE**: Runs an on-demand review that applies to the current file, uncommitted changes, or the active branch.
- **When I type code**: Reviews code continuously as you write, automatically analyzing changes and highlighting potential issues.

### AI-driven development

Configure analysis depth for reviews triggered through AI assistants:

- **When AI agent writes code**: Automatically reviews code generated by an AI assistant as it is produced.
- **When I ask AI agent to review code**: Runs a review when you explicitly request a review from an AI assistant.

The default configuration uses **Deep** for human-driven workflows and **Instant** for AI-driven workflows. For critical code, choose **Deep** regardless of workflow—use it for final reviews, production changes, and any time correctness matters more than speed.
