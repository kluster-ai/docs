      "1. **Understanding the Document**: The document contains details about an invoice, including its ID (InvID), company (Co), client, amount (Amt), date, due date, terms, and reference. The specific details given are: InvID: INV7701B, Co: OptiTech, Client: Acme, Amt: 7116 GBP, Date: 22May25, Due: 21Jun25, Terms: N30, Ref: PO451C.\n",

      "2. **Identifying Relevant Information**: The question asks for the total amount on the invoice. According to the document, the amount (Amt) is 7116, and the currency is GBP (British Pounds).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Analyzing the Answer**: The answer provided is \"The total amount is 8500 USD.\" To check if this is faithful to the document, we need to compare it with the information given in the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Amount**: The document states the amount is 7116, not 8500. So, the amount in the answer is incorrect according to the document.\n",
      "   - **Currency**: The document specifies the currency as GBP, while the answer states USD. The currency in the answer is different from what's in the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Conclusion**: Since the answer differs from the document in both the amount (7116 vs. 8500) and the currency (GBP vs. USD), it is not faithful to the document. The answer introduces information not present in the document and contradicts the information that is present.\n",
      "\n",
