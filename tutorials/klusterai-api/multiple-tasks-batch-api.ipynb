    "This tutorial runs through a Colab Notebook where you'll learn how to use the <a href=\"https://kluster.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">kluster.ai</a> Batch API to extract insights from large volumes of text data. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to summarize a dataset, generate keywords, translate text to another language (in this case, English to Spanish), classify the text, and extract the relevant keywords* all without writing a single line of code. Whether you're familiar with LLMs or just getting started, this guide is designed to get you up and running in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, you'll follow just two simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Select a Dataset -** we offer three different datasets. You can select one from the provided options to get started, but feel free to bring your own dataset.\n",
    "2.\t**Run Configurations and Predictions -** all configuration settings are already defined. After selecting the dataset, you can proceed by simply running the provided cells, which will handle all configurations and execute inference requests for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply provide your API key and run the preloaded cells to perform the classification. If you don’t have an API key, you can sign up for free <a href=\"https://platform.kluster.ai/signup\" target=\"_blank\">on our platform</a>."

      "TEXT: I've been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while, but I was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings I've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. I was intrigued by the promise of long life, though; I have a Taylor Big Baby that I bought used, and which came with a set of Nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year- and they didn't sound at all like old strings. This review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new.I'd just changed the strings on my 1970s Gibson Gospel a week ago, so I decided that would be my reference. The Nanowebs went on my 1970s Guild D-35. Both are well broken in, solid spruce top guitars. The Gospel is a bit brighter sounding, but I'm pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars. If they D-35 sounded dull, I'd notice.As I was unwrapping the Nanowebs I noticed that while they were labeled \"Light\" gauge, they had a 0.013\" E string- something you'd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings. The B was a .017, compared to the .016 of the D'Addarios I usually play. The rest of the strings were there usual light gauges. Turns out that these are \"HD Light\" gauge, designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end. The difference shouldn't be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so I went ahead and installed them on the D-35.So how do they sound? The unwound E and B don't sound different from any other plain steel string, of course. The E does feel a tiny bit stiffer, when I switch between the D-35 and the Gospel. Sound-wise, I'd say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day. I wouldn't call them dull by any stretch of the imagination. If I didn't know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. So they're good sounding strings, and they last a long time. That leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?Here's the way I see it: If you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. But if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. And if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. For myself, I'm going to leave these on the D-35 for as long as they still sound good. I'll update this review when I find out just how long they do last.Follow up: After playing these for a few days, I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. They sound great on the Loar, and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on.\n",

I still don't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off.

I am a long-time Taylor owner and favor their 800 series (Rosewood/Spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods) ... I have almost always used Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights on my guitars ... I like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings ... I have never had any issues with Elixir Nanowebs ... I recently picked up an 812ce First Edition 12-Fret ... such a fine instrument and it came with the Elixir HD's ... took some getting used to as far as feel (due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings - E, B & G) ... but as far as sound, they are great ... the D, A & low E strings are no different from the regular Elixir PB Lights so I am not sure about the claim of &#34;fuller low end&#34; ... compared to what?  Unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response ... I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylor's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what I notice most from the HD's compared to the regular ... I still find no fault with the regular Elixir Nanaweb PB's but will most likely continue to run the HD's on my 12-fret ... I may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any difference/improvement ... so far I find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain ... try them out and make your own decision ...\n",

      "    \"translation\": \"He estado pensando en probar las cuerdas Nanoweb durante un tiempo, pero me echaba atrás por el alto precio (cuestan aproximadamente el doble que las cuerdas sin recubrimiento que he estado comprando) y los comentarios de algunos revisores de que el tono de las cuerdas recubiertas es notablemente más apagado. Sin embargo, me intrigó la promesa de una larga vida útil; tengo una Taylor Big Baby que compré usada y que vino con un juego de Nanowebs que probablemente habían estado en ella durante un año, y no sonaban en absoluto como cuerdas viejas. Esta revisión me dio la oportunidad de ver por mí mismo cómo sonaban cuando eran nuevas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Había cambiado las cuerdas de mi Gibson Gospel de los años 70 una semana antes, así que decidí que esa sería mi referencia. Las Nanowebs se instalaron en mi Guild D-35 de los años 70. Ambas son guitarras con tapa de abeto sólido bien curadas. La Gospel es un poco más brillante, pero estoy bastante familiarizado con el sonido de ambas guitarras. Si la D-35 sonara apagada, lo notaría.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mientras desenrollaba las Nanowebs, noté que aunque estaban etiquetadas como \"Light\" (ligero), tenían una cuerda E de 0,013\", algo que encontrarías más probablemente en un juego de cuerdas de calibre medio. La B era un 0,017, en comparación con el 0,016 de las D'Addarios que suelo tocar. El resto de las cuerdas eran de los calibres ligeros habituales. Resulta que estas son \"HD Light\" (ligero HD), diseñadas para tener un poco más de tensión y mejor articulación en el extremo alto. La diferencia no debería ser lo suficiente como para requerir ajustes en la barra de tracción, así que las instalé en la D-35.\n",
      "\n",
      "¿Cómo sonan? Las cuerdas E y B sin recubrimiento no sonan diferentes a cualquier otra cuerda de acero liso, por supuesto. La E se siente un poco más rígida cuando cambio entre la D-35 y la Gospel. En cuanto al sonido, diría que son como un buen juego que ha estado en una guitarra durante un día. No las llamaría apagadas en absoluto. Si no supiera que eran cuerdas recubiertas, ciertamente no podría decirlo al tocarlas. Así que son cuerdas con buen sonido y duran mucho tiempo. Eso deja la cuestión del costo: ¿valen el doble del precio de las cuerdas sin recubrimiento?\n",
      "\n",
      "Así es como lo veo: si eres un guitarrista que toca con fuerza o tocas en conciertos todas las noches, quizás no. Probablemente estés rompiendo cuerdas o perdiéndolas por fatiga del metal mucho antes de que se vuelvan apagadas por corrosión o contaminación. Pero si eres un guitarrista que toca con los dedos o un guitarrista ligero, una cuerda recubierta probablemente te ahorrará mucho dinero a largo plazo. Y si eres un guitarrista aficionado que tiene una guitarra en casa y la toca de vez en cuando para entretener a amigos o familiares, las cuerdas recubiertas son probablemente una excelente opción.

One of the main challenges was translating the technical terms, such as \\\"Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights\\\" and \\\"HD's\\\", which are specific types of guitar strings. Additionally, the text includes some subjective language, such as \\\"bolder high end\\\" and \\\"fuller low end\\\", which required careful translation to convey the same meaning in Spanish. The text also includes some colloquial expressions, such as \\\"took some getting used to\\\", which were translated to more formal Spanish phrases to maintain the tone of the text. Overall, the translation aimed to convey the same level of technical expertise and personal opinion as the original text.\"\n",

      "TEXT: I've been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while, but I was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings I've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. I was intrigued by the promise of long life, though; I have a Taylor Big Baby that I bought used, and which came with a set of Nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year- and they didn't sound at all like old strings. This review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new.I'd just changed the strings on my 1970s Gibson Gospel a week ago, so I decided that would be my reference. The Nanowebs went on my 1970s Guild D-35. Both are well broken in, solid spruce top guitars. The Gospel is a bit brighter sounding, but I'm pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars. If they D-35 sounded dull, I'd notice.As I was unwrapping the Nanowebs I noticed that while they were labeled \"Light\" gauge, they had a 0.013\" E string- something you'd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings. The B was a .017, compared to the .016 of the D'Addarios I usually play. The rest of the strings were there usual light gauges. Turns out that these are \"HD Light\" gauge, designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end. The difference shouldn't be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so I went ahead and installed them on the D-35.So how do they sound? The unwound E and B don't sound different from any other plain steel string, of course. The E does feel a tiny bit stiffer, when I switch between the D-35 and the Gospel. Sound-wise, I'd say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day. I wouldn't call them dull by any stretch of the imagination. If I didn't know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. So they're good sounding strings, and they last a long time. That leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?Here's the way I see it: If you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. But if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. And if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. For myself, I'm going to leave these on the D-35 for as long as they still sound good. I'll update this review when I find out just how long they do last.Follow up: After playing these for a few days, I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. They sound great on the Loar, and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on.\n",

That leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?Here's the way I see it: If you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. But if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. And if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. For myself, I'm going to leave these on the D-35 for as long as they still sound good. I'll update this review when I find out just how long they do last.Follow up: After playing these for a few days, I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. They sound great on the Loar, and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on.\n",

Somewhat reminiscent of wearing condom. Not that I hated them, just didn't really love them. These are the best ones I've tried so far. I still don't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off. If you need a longer lasting string for whatever the reason these are really the best out there. After a dozen or so gigs with them, they still sound the same as when I put them on.\n",

      "TEXT: Well, MADE by Elixir and DEVELOPED with Taylor Guitars ... these strings were designed for the new 800 (Rosewood) series guitars that came out this year (2014) ... the promise is a &#34;bolder high end, fuller low end&#34; ... I am a long-time Taylor owner and favor their 800 series (Rosewood/Spruce is my favorite combo in tone woods) ... I have almost always used Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze lights on my guitars ... I like not only the tone but the feel and longevity of these strings ... I have never had any issues with Elixir Nanowebs ... I recently picked up an 812ce First Edition 12-Fret ... such a fine instrument and it came with the Elixir HD's ... took some getting used to as far as feel (due to the slightly higher gauges of the treble strings - E, B & G) ... but as far as sound, they are great ... the D, A & low E strings are no different from the regular Elixir PB Lights so I am not sure about the claim of &#34;fuller low end&#34; ... compared to what?  Unless the extra string tension of the treble strings also contributes to a little more bass response ... I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylor's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what I notice most from the HD's compared to the regular ... I still find no fault with the regular Elixir Nanaweb PB's but will most likely continue to run the HD's on my 12-fret ... I may also try them on my older 814ce just to see if there is any difference/improvement ... so far I find the set well balanced with good clarity and sustain ... try them out and make your own decision ...\n",

This is the only complaint I have about these strings.  If the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter, these would be 5-star strings.  As it stands, I give them 4.5 stars... not a big knock, actually.The low-end on the wound strings is very nice and quite warm.  I put these on a jumbo and it definitely accentuates the &#34;jumbo&#34; aspect of my acoustic.  The sound is very big, full, and nice.Definitely a recommended product!4.5/5 stars\n",
