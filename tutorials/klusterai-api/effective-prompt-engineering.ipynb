    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) toward high‑quality responses. Well‑designed prompts can turn vague outputs into precise, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how prompt quality affects LLM performance by comparing three levels of prompts—Bad, Better, and Best—in a retail sales analysis scenario. The goal: uncover strategies to grow the business and boost profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a simple retail dataset with sales, pricing, and profit data, you’ll see how adding structure, context, and business‑specific details transforms basic observations into strategic recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll be equipped to apply these principles to your own business data using any of the [supported models](https://docs.kluster.ai/api-reference/reference/#list-supported-models) available through the [kluster.ai](https://kluster.ai/) API—unlocking deeper, more valuable insights.\n"

    "### Analysis of the best prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "The Best prompt excels because it integrates comprehensive data (product sales, prices, and profit margins) with detailed business context (target demographics, product characteristics, marketing channels, and specific challenges). By explicitly specifying the desired structure—including step-by-step revenue and profit analysis, targeted profitability recommendations, and marketing optimizations—it guides the LLM toward high-value, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key strengths of this Best prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete data & metrics** - monthly sales, pricing, and profit margins remove guesswork and allow precise revenue/profit calculations\n",
    "- **Focused business context** - target customer demographics, marketing channels, and product nuances (e.g., overstock of Product C) align the output with real business priorities\n",
    "- **Clear task breakdown** - dividing the request into distinct sections (Revenue/Profit Analysis, Profitability Recommendations, Marketing Strategies) ensures the response is both methodical and thorough\n",
    "- **Actionability & specificity** - the prompt requests concrete next steps—such as pricing tweaks and promotional ideas—tailored to each product's characteristics and customer segment\n",
    "- **Logical reasoning instructions** - guiding the LLM to \"think step-by-step\" fosters more thoughtful planning, especially around clearing excess inventory and leveraging different marketing channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this approach maximizes the LLM's potential, yielding responses that are precise, context-aware, and immediately useful to decision-makers."

    "\n",
    "Using an LLM to refine your prompt might sound meta, but it’s a powerful way to accelerate your prompt engineering learning curve. By harnessing AI to analyze and tweak your own queries, you can rapidly elevate the quality of your prompts and, ultimately, your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "While our best prompt is already strong, prompting an LLM for further improvements highlighted additional considerations, such as setting a clear time horizon, specifying budget constraints (e.g., a $2,000 monthly marketing budget), and assessing potential risks (e.g., pitfalls of new approaches). Incorporating these refinements can make your prompts more actionable and better aligned with real-world business needs.\n",

    "### Analysis of the AI-enhanced prompt vs. the existing best prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI‑enhanced prompt is stronger because it embeds several best‑practice elements that the baseline prompt omits:\n",
    "- **Explicit time horizon** — sets \"within 3 to 6 months,\" anchoring the LLM's reasoning to short‑term profitability rather than an open‑ended strategy\n",
    "- **Hard marketing‑budget constraint** — imposes a $2,000 limit, forcing any recommendations to remain fiscally realistic\n",
    "- **Prioritization requirement** — asks the model to \"rank steps by highest immediate impact,\" ensuring an ordered action plan instead of an unstructured list\n",
    "- **Risk/trade‑off note** — requests a brief downside analysis for every suggestion, prompting the LLM to surface potential drawbacks proactively\n",
    "- **Supporting calculations** — calls for relevant calculations, promoting transparency and verifiability\n",
    "\n",
    "These additions sharpen the prompt's clarity, specificity, and operational relevance; they tell the model exactly what to deliver, within which limits, and how to present it, thereby increasing the likelihood of receiving actionable, decision‑ready insights regardless of which LLM you use."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This side-by-side comparison demonstrates how the quality and specificity of a prompt directly influence the depth, utility, and strategic value of an LLM's output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bad prompt** - minimal data and vague instructions yield only superficial insights—no clear direction or actionable strategies\n",
    "- **Better prompt** - adding pricing details and specific tasks (like calculating revenue or ranking products) results in more concrete analysis and targeted recommendations\n",
    "- **Best prompt** - providing comprehensive context—including profit margins, demographics, inventory challenges, and explicit formatting instructions—empowers the model to deliver nuanced, highly actionable advice aligned with real business needs\n",
    "- **AI‑enhanced prompt** — layering on a defined 3‑to‑6‑month time horizon, a fixed $2,000 marketing budget, ranked priorities, risk/trade‑off notes, and requests for supporting calculations guides the model to provide an even more operationally realistic, budget‑aware, and immediately implementable plan of action\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways for effective prompt engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide relevant context** - include all essential data (pricing, margins, customer segments) to enable deeper analysis\n",
    "- **Specify instructions clearly** - outline the tasks, format, and reasoning style (e.g., step-by-step) you want the model to follow\n",
    "- **Articulate business constraints and goals** - highlight challenges (e.g., excess inventory, limited budget) to guide strategic recommendations\n",
    "- **Structure the output requirements** - break down the response into clear, logical sections (analysis, recommendations, marketing, etc.)\n",
    "- **Iterate for best results** - incrementally refining prompts yields exponentially better outcomes—invest time upfront for far greater business value\n",
    "\n",
    "By enriching prompts with thorough details and well-defined objectives, you unlock the full potential of LLMs to generate accurate, context-aware, and immediately applicable insights."
