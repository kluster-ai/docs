    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the dramatic impact of prompt quality on LLM performance by comparing three increasingly sophisticated prompts, namely _Bad_, _Better_, and _Best_, applied to a retail sales analysis scenario. You'll see firsthand how adding structure, context, and specific business parameters transforms model outputs from basic observations into comprehensive strategic recommendations.\n",

      "1. **Increase Marketing for Lower-Performing Products:** Focus on increasing visibility and promotional efforts for Product C, as it has the lowest sales and revenue. Consider targeted advertising, special promotions, or bundling it with more popular products to increase its appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Product Bundling:** Offer discounts for customers who purchase multiple products together. This could be particularly effective for Product C, which has low sales but a high price point, suggesting it might be less appealing to price-sensitive customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Competitive Pricing Analysis:** Conduct a competitive pricing analysis for Product B, as it has a high volume of sales but a relatively low price point. Consider if increasing its price slightly could increase profitability without significantly impacting demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhance Product Appeal:** For Product C, which has a high price but low sales, consider enhancing its appeal through premium branding, highlighting its unique features, or offering a 'limited edition' version to attract more attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dynamic Pricing:** Implement dynamic pricing strategies that adjust based on demand, time of year, and customer segments. This could help in maximizing revenue during peak seasons or for high-demand products.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Recommendations for Pricing and Marketing Adjustments\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Pricing Adjustments:**\n",
      "- **Product C:** Given its low sales, consider a price reduction or a promotional offer to boost its appeal. A temporary discount or bundle deal could make it more attractive to customers.\n",
      "- **Product B:** As the best-selling product, consider if there's room to increase its price without affecting demand significantly. A small price increase could lead to higher profitability without a substantial drop in sales volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Marketing Strategies:**\n",
      "- **Product C:** Implement a targeted marketing campaign focusing on its unique value proposition. Highlighting its premium features or quality could attract a niche audience willing to pay more.\n",
      "- **Product A and D:** Since these are performing well, consider cross-promoting them with Product C or B to increase overall sales and basket size.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "- **Market Research:** Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand why Product C and A aren't selling as much, focusing on customer perceptions and potential barriers to purchase.\n",
      "- **Promotional Offers:** Create limited-time offers or special editions of Product C to attract more customers and increase its visibility.\n",
      "- **Optimize Product Display:** Ensure that all products, especially Product C, are prominently displayed in-store and online, with compelling product descriptions and high-quality images.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these strategies, the store can potentially increase sales of lower-performing products and optimize its pricing and marketing strategies for better profitability across the board. Continuous monitoring of sales data and customer feedback will be crucial to adjust these strategies as needed.\n"

    "1. **Be Explicit About Goals and Domain Context** - Clearly state what you want to achieve, who the audience is, and any industry-specific details—this helps the LLM provide targeted, relevant improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Highlight Known Issues or Constraints** - If your current prompt produces certain errors or must follow specific guidelines, mention these explicitly to guide the LLM’s focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Leverage Role/System Instructions (If Available)** - Where supported, place overarching context or constraints in a “system” or “role” prompt so that all subsequent prompts inherit these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Request Structural and Formatting Advice** - Ask the LLM to recommend a well-organized structure (e.g., bullet points, sections) and specify any required output format (e.g., JSON, bullet points, Q&A).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterate and Compare Results** - After applying the LLM’s suggestions, run both the original and improved prompts, compare the outcomes, and continue refining until you’re satisfied."

    "\n",
    "This side-by-side comparison demonstrates how the quality and specificity of a prompt directly influence the depth, utility, and strategic value of an LLM's output:\n",
    "* **Bad prompt:** Minimal data and vague instructions yield only superficial insights—no clear direction or actionable strategies.\n",
    "* **Better prompt:** Adding pricing details and specific tasks (like calculating revenue or ranking products) results in more concrete analysis and targeted recommendations.\n",
    "* **Best prompt:** Providing comprehensive context—including profit margins, demographics, inventory challenges, and explicit formatting instructions—empowers the model to deliver nuanced, highly actionable advice aligned with real business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways for Effective Prompt Engineering\n",
    "* **Provide relevant context:** Include all essential data (pricing, margins, customer segments) to enable deeper analysis.\n",
    "* **Specify instructions clearly:** Outline the tasks, format, and reasoning style (e.g., step-by-step) you want the model to follow.\n",
    "* **Articulate business constraints and goals:** Highlight challenges (e.g., excess inventory, limited budget) to guide strategic recommendations.\n",
    "* **Structure the output requirements:** Break down the response into clear, logical sections (analysis, recommendations, marketing, etc.).\n",
    "* **Iterate for best results:** Incrementally refining prompts yields exponentially better outcomes—invest time upfront for far greater business value.\n",
    "\n",
    "By enriching prompts with thorough details and well-defined objectives, you unlock the full potential of LLMs to generate accurate, context-aware, and immediately applicable insights."
