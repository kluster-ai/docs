    "Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) toward high‑quality responses. Well‑designed prompts can turn vague outputs into precise, actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how prompt quality affects LLM performance by comparing three levels of prompts—Bad, Better, and Best—in a retail sales analysis scenario. The goal: uncover strategies to grow the business and boost profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a simple retail dataset with sales, pricing, and profit data, you’ll see how adding structure, context, and business‑specific details transforms basic observations into strategic recommendations.\n",

    "### Analysis of the AI-enhanced prompt vs. the existing best prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI‑enhanced prompt is stronger because it embeds several best‑practice elements that the baseline prompt omits. First, it sets an explicit time horizon (“within 3 to 6 months”), which anchors the LLM’s reasoning to short‑term profitability instead of open‑ended strategy. Second, it introduces a hard marketing‑budget constraint ($2,000), forcing any recommendations to be fiscally realistic. Third, the prompt requests prioritization (“rank steps by highest immediate impact”), ensuring the model returns an ordered action plan rather than an unstructured list. Fourth, it calls for a brief risk or trade‑off note with every suggestion, prompting the LLM to surface downsides proactively. Finally, it asks for supporting calculations where relevant, promoting transparency and verifiability. These additions sharpen the prompt’s clarity, specificity, and operational relevance; they tell the model exactly what to deliver, within which limits, and how to present it, thereby increasing the likelihood of receiving actionable, decision‑ready insights regardless of which LLM you use."

    "This side-by-side comparison demonstrates how the quality and specificity of a prompt directly influence the depth, utility, and strategic value of an LLM's output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bad prompt** - minimal data and vague instructions yield only superficial insights—no clear direction or actionable strategies\n",
    "- **Better prompt** - adding pricing details and specific tasks (like calculating revenue or ranking products) results in more concrete analysis and targeted recommendations\n",
    "- **Best prompt** - providing comprehensive context—including profit margins, demographics, inventory challenges, and explicit formatting instructions—empowers the model to deliver nuanced, highly actionable advice aligned with real business needs\n",
    "- **AI‑enhanced prompt** — layering on a defined 3‑to‑6‑month time horizon, a fixed $2,000 marketing budget, ranked priorities, risk/trade‑off notes, and requests for supporting calculations guides the model to provide an even more operationally realistic, budget‑aware, and immediately implementable plan of action\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways for Effective Prompt Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide relevant context** - include all essential data (pricing, margins, customer segments) to enable deeper analysis\n",
    "- **Specify instructions clearly** - outline the tasks, format, and reasoning style (e.g., step-by-step) you want the model to follow\n",
    "- **Articulate business constraints and goals** - highlight challenges (e.g., excess inventory, limited budget) to guide strategic recommendations\n",
    "- **Structure the output requirements** - break down the response into clear, logical sections (analysis, recommendations, marketing, etc.)\n",
    "- **Iterate for best results** - incrementally refining prompts yields exponentially better outcomes—invest time upfront for far greater business value\n",
