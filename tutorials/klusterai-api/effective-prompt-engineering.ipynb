    "# Effective prompt engineering with the kluster.ai API\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, and can dramatically improve the quality of results.  Effective prompt design helps shape how the model interprets and responds to a query, often making the difference between vague, generic outputs and precise, actionable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the dramatic impact of prompt quality on LLM performance by comparing three increasingly sophisticated prompts, namely _Bad_, _Better_, and _Best_, applied to a retail sales analysis scenario. The ultimate goal in this hypothetical scenario is to learn how to grow the business and increase profits. You'll see firsthand how adding structure, context, and specific business parameters transforms model outputs from basic observations into comprehensive strategic recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a simple retail dataset containing product sales figures, pricing information, and profit margins to illustrate how enriching prompts with relevant business context enables models to deliver increasingly valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you can apply these prompt engineering principles to your own business data using any of the [supported models](https://docs.kluster.ai/api-reference/reference/#list-supported-models) available from the kluster.ai API, dramatically improving the quality and utility of AI-generated insights for your specific use cases."

      "- **Bundle with Popular Products:** Create a bundle or package deal that includes Product A and another popular product to increase its appeal and drive sales.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### For Product D:\n",

      "\n",
      "### 4. Recommendations for Adjusting Pricing or Marketing\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pricing Adjustments:\n",
      "- **Product C:** Given its low sales performance, consider if a price reduction could stimulate demand. If the product has a high margin, even a slight reduction could make it more appealing.\n",
      "- **Product A:** If Product A has a high margin, explore if a slight price increase could be beneficial, assuming demand isn't overly sensitive to price changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Marketing Strategies:\n",
      "- **Product C:** Implement a \"buy one get one free\" or \"50% off\" promotion for a limited time to gauge interest and potentially boost sales.\n",
      "- **Product A:** Since it has moderate sales, focus on maintaining or slightly increasing its price if the market allows, while emphasizing its value proposition through marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cross-Promotion and Upselling:\n",
      "- **Combine Products in Offers:** Create promotions that bundle lower-performing products (like Product C) with best-sellers (like Product B) to increase the overall basket size and drive sales of underperforming items.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data-Driven Decisions:\n",
      "- **Analyze Customer Feedback:** Understand why Product C and Product A aren't selling as well as others. Is it due to lack of awareness, poor fit with the market, or competition? Tailor marketing strategies based on customer insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Action Plan:\n",
      "1. **Short-Term:** Implement targeted marketing for Product C and adjust pricing strategies for Product A if deemed necessary.\n",
      "2. **Long-Term:** Continuously monitor sales data and adjust strategies as needed. Consider seasonal trends and consumer behavior shifts when planning future promotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "By implementing these strategies, the store can potentially increase sales of lower-performing products and maintain or grow revenue from the best-performing ones. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of sales strategies based on customer feedback and market trends will be crucial for optimizing performance across all products.\n"

      "- **Product A:** Maintain current pricing and consider a loyalty program to encourage repeat purchases.\n",

      "- **Product C:** Clear excess inventory by offering a **limited-time discount** (e.g., 20% off) to incentivize purchases. This will help reduce overstock and free up capital for other products.\n",

      "- **Email Newsletters:** Highlight Product A and Product D, as they have consistent demand and higher profit margins. Offer exclusive discounts to subscribers to drive repeat business.\n",

      "\n",
      "### **Additional Recommendations:**\n",

    "\n",
    "Using an LLM to refine your prompt might sound meta, but it’s a powerful way to accelerate your prompt engineering learning curve. By harnessing AI to analyze and tweak your own queries, you can rapidly elevate the quality of your prompts and, ultimately, your results. While our best prompt is already strong, prompting an LLM for further improvements highlighted additional considerations, such as setting a clear time horizon, specifying budget constraints (e.g., a $2,000 monthly marketing budget), and assessing potential risks (e.g., pitfalls of new approaches). Incorporating these refinements can make your prompts more actionable and better aligned with real-world business needs.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI-enhanced prompt generates responses with significantly greater business value through several key improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Depth of analysis**: It provides a breakdown not just of revenue and profit, but also a granular look at product-specific pricing strategies, risk considerations, and marketing budget allocation. It includes explicit calculations and a logical step-by-step structure\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structured risk assessment**: For each recommendation (e.g., discounting Product C or increasing the price on Product A), the model notes potential drawbacks or trade-offs. This proactive assessment of risks adds realism and practical value\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Marketing budget details**: The response offers precise spending allocations (Instagram vs. email vs. weekend promotions), making it more actionable. It addresses different demographic targets (young adults vs. middle-aged professionals) using specific channels\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendation prioritization**: By ranking the highest-impact items (e.g., first deal with Product C's excess inventory), the user can see an ordered plan of action\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Concise summary**: The model neatly summarizes the key points (e.g., best/worst performers, recommended strategies, marketing channel spend)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall value**: This response is more comprehensive and directly aligned with typical business decision-making workflows. It not only answers \"what should we do?\" but also \"why this approach and what are the trade-offs?\""

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This side-by-side comparison demonstrates how the quality and specificity of a prompt directly influence the depth, utility, and strategic value of an LLM's output:\n",
    "* **Bad prompt:** Minimal data and vague instructions yield only superficial insights—no clear direction or actionable strategies\n",
    "* **Better prompt:** Adding pricing details and specific tasks (like calculating revenue or ranking products) results in more concrete analysis and targeted recommendations\n",
    "* **Best prompt:** Providing comprehensive context—including profit margins, demographics, inventory challenges, and explicit formatting instructions—empowers the model to deliver nuanced, highly actionable advice aligned with real business needs\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways for Effective Prompt Engineering\n",
    "* **Provide relevant context:** Include all essential data (pricing, margins, customer segments) to enable deeper analysis\n",
    "* **Specify instructions clearly:** Outline the tasks, format, and reasoning style (e.g., step-by-step) you want the model to follow\n",
    "* **Articulate business constraints and goals:** Highlight challenges (e.g., excess inventory, limited budget) to guide strategic recommendations\n",
    "* **Structure the output requirements:** Break down the response into clear, logical sections (analysis, recommendations, marketing, etc.)\n",
    "* **Iterate for best results:** Incrementally refining prompts yields exponentially better outcomes—invest time upfront for far greater business value\n",
    "\n",
    "By enriching prompts with thorough details and well-defined objectives, you unlock the full potential of LLMs to generate accurate, context-aware, and immediately applicable insights."
