    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases how to use the <a href=\"https://kluster.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">kluster.ai</a> Batch API to classify a data set based on a predefined set of categories. In our example, we use an extract from the IMDB top 1000 movies dataset and categorize them into one of “Action”, “Adventure”, “Comedy”, “Crime”, “Documentary”, “Drama”, “Fantasy”, “Horror”, “Romance”, or “Sci-Fi”. We are using a movies dataset but you can adapt this example by using your data and categories relevant for your use case. With this approach, you can effortlessly process datasets of any scale, from small collections to extensive datasets, and obtain categorized results powered by a state-of-the-art language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply provide your API key and run the preloaded cells to perform the classification. If you don’t have an API key, you can sign up for free <a href=\"https://platform.kluster.ai/signup\" target=\"_blank\">on our platform</a>.\n",
